  - Specific product details (dimensions, materials, features, data amounts)
  - Product modifications (changing names, values, or any attributes)
  - Exact specifications or pricing
  - ANY request to update/modify/change product parameters
  - Direct responses to product detail forms/templates

- General conversations include:

  - Questions about the process
  - Initial inquiries or greetings
  - General discussion without details

### Examples:
<example>
Product-related:
- "Create a product with 10GB data."
- "Update the product name to Data29."
- "Change the validity to 30 days."
  
General conversation:
- "I want to create a product."
- "How do I start?"
- "What's the best way to design?"

         Extract the following information from the conversation and format it as JSON. Use the exact field names from the provided schema.

        **Conversation:**
        {messages}

        **Product Schema:**
        {product_schema}

        **CORE RULES:**
        1. ALWAYS keep default schema values unless explicitly asked to change them
        2. NEVER set a default value to null during product creation
        3. ONLY set fields to null when explicitly asked to change without a new value

        **Field Processing Rules:**

        1. NEW PRODUCT CREATION:
        - Keep ALL schema default values (e.g., GSM, Prepaid, Normal, etc.)
        - keep product description same as product name 
        - Only modify fields explicitly mentioned in request
        - Example: "create product with name test"
          - Changes: ONLY product_name/description
          - Everything else: KEEPS SCHEMA DEFAULTS

        2. FIELD MODIFICATIONS:
        - ONLY modify the exact field mentioned
        - ALL other fields keep their current values
        - Set to null ONLY when field change requested without new value
        - When the user mentions 'update [specification] to [value]', update that specification with the new value and maintain the rest of the product details as they are
        - Examples:
          - "change price_mode" → price_mode: null, rest unchanged
          - "set group to Postpaid" → product_group: "Postpaid", rest unchanged
          
         
         

        3. FIELD SPECIFIC HANDLING:
         **Product Name / Pack Name / Plan Name**:
         - Only extract if explicitly mentioned (e.g., "Data Pack Plus", "Freedom Plan"). If no specific name is provided, keep it empty dont assume anything.
         PRODUCT_NAME_EXTRACTION_RULES
        1. ONLY extract the EXACT product name mentioned by the user
        2. DO NOT modify, interpret, or create a name if not explicitly stated
        3. If NO specific name is provided, leave the product_name EMPTY
         - Set the `product_name` field to be the same as the `product_description`.
        **Product_offer_price**:
        - This field represents the price or cost of the product. Only Extract any price-related information here. The value must be a **numeric string** with no additional text, symbols, or units (e.g., 10 dollars, 5 dollar, 3$ or any currency).
        **Data and Voice Allowance**:
        - Extract the **data_allowance** and **voice_allowance** if explicitly mentioned
        - Extract the **data allowance** (e.g., "20 GB", "10 MB") in the `data_allowance` field .
        - Extract the **voice allowance** (e.g., "100 minutes", "100 MINS", "flexi minutes", "100 seconds") in the `voice_allowance` field.  
        - If not mentioned, keep existing values
      -Keep in mind that days months if user is telling then it is validity not data or voice allowance
        
      

        4. JSON OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
        - Include ALL schema fields
        - Keep ALL default values from schema
        - Only change specifically mentioned fields
        - No quotes around JSON object

        VALIDATION STEPS:
        1. Check all schema default values are preserved
        2. Verify only mentioned fields are modified
        3. Confirm null only used for explicit change requests

        DO NOT set fields to null unless explicitly requested to change them. Keep schema defaults for all unmentioned fields.

        **Conversation:**

        **Guidelines:**

        DEFAULT VALUE RULES FROM PRODUCT SCHEMA:
        - When creating a new product, ALL default values from the schema MUST be preserved
        - Only override fields that are explicitly mentioned in the user request
        - Fields with default values should NEVER become null during product creation
        - Null values should only be set when explicitly changing a field without providing a new value

        1. CRITICAL FIELD CHANGE RULES:
        - When processing a "change" request, ONLY modify the SPECIFICALLY mentioned field
        - If user says "change price_mode", ONLY price_mode should become null
        - If user says "update product_group to Postpaid", ONLY product_group should change
        - NEVER modify fields that aren't explicitly mentioned in the request
        - ALL other fields must retain their exact previous values

        2. Field Change Detection Examples:
        - Message: "change price_mode" → ONLY price_mode becomes null
        - Message: "update product_group to Postpaid" → ONLY product_group changes
        - Message: "modify product_family" → ONLY product_family becomes null
        - Message: "create product with name test" → ONLY product_name changes

        3. Value Assignment Rules:
        - For explicit change without value: Set ONLY that field to null
            Example: "change price_mode" → price_mode: null
        - For change with new value: Set ONLY that field to new value
            Example: "set group to Postpaid" → product_group: "Postpaid"
        - For all other fields: Keep their existing values exactly as is

        4. **Product Name / Pack Name / Plan Name**:
        - Only extract if explicitly mentioned by the user
        - If no specific name is provided, keep the field empty
        - please keep the product description same as product name 

        5. **Product_offer_price**:
        - This field represents the price or cost of the product. Extract any price-related information here. The value must be a **numeric string** with no additional text, symbols, or units. 
        

        6. **Data and Voice Allowance**:
        - Extract the **data_allowance** and **voice_allowance** if explicitly mentioned
        - If not mentioned, keep existing values

        7. Field Update Validation:
        - Before updating any field, verify it was explicitly mentioned
        - Do not modify fields by inference or assumption
        - When in doubt, preserve the existing field value

        8. **JSON Format**:
        - Provide the output strictly as JSON
        - Do not include any quotes before or after the JSON object

        Please extract the product information based on these guidelines and ensure ONLY mentioned fields are modified.
